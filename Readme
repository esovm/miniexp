Colleague Work: implementation of mini expert system

In GHCi type

  runFwdMode exmWM exmENG
  
    -- to run forward mode, where:
          exmWM  -- example working memory
          exmENG -- example inference engine
        
  runBwdMode exmWM exmENG (Fact "Animal is penguin")
  
    -- to prove that animal is penguin. To prove something
       else, replace "Animal is penguin" by your statement.
       But you should change `exmWM` (and maybe `exmENG`)
       in order to prove it too.
